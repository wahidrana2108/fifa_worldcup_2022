The FIFA World Cup 2022 website is a responsive platform that provides visitors with a wide range of features and functionalities. Users can access the website to view the match schedule, player list, and player profiles. They can search for specific players and browse players by various categories. The website also offers blogs and news articles related to the World Cup, allowing users to stay updated on the latest events and developments.

One notable aspect of the website is its user registration system. Visitors can create an account using a valid email address, and email verification is required to activate their account. To ensure security, the user's password is hashed, protecting it from unauthorized access. Users have the option to update their subscription preferences and can modify their personal details and passwords as needed. In case of a forgotten password, they can recover it using an OTP (One-Time Password) link.

The website incorporates strong security measures to safeguard user and admin credentials. Special attention has been given to prevent any leaks of sensitive information. Within the admin panel, administrators have full control over player, team, news, and blog management. They can enter, delete, and edit these components. However, the admin panel does not allow them to modify any customer details except for viewing their visitor IDs. This ensures that customer information remains secure and cannot be tampered with by administrators.

Overall, the FIFA World Cup website offers an engaging and secure experience for visitors, providing them with a comprehensive platform to explore tournament details, player information, news articles, and blogs, while maintaining the privacy and security of user and admin data.
